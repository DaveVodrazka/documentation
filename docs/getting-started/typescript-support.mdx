# Using Typescript with Apibara

You can use Typescript with Apibara to implement fully type-safe indexers. This
means you can take advantage of modern Typescript libraries such as Zod,
Starknet.js, and Viem.


## Getting started

You can import types from the `@apibara/indexer` package. Since the Apibara
runtime is based on Deno, you need to import the package from a CDN such as
Skypack or ESM.sh. [Please refer to the Deno documentation to learn more about
importing NPM packages in Deno](https://deno.land/manual/node/cdns).

The following example shows how to use the `@apibara/indexer` package to type
the exported configuration and transformer function.

```ts
import type { Config } from "https://esm.sh/@apibara/indexer";
import type {
  Block,
  Starknet,
} from "https://esm.sh/@apibara/indexer/starknet";
import type { Console } from "https://esm.sh/@apibara/indexer/sink/console";

export const config: Config<Starknet, Console> = {
  streamUrl: "https://goerli.starknet.a5a.ch",
  network: "starknet",
  filter: {
    header: {},
  },
  startingBlock: 800_000,
  sinkType: "console",
  sinkOptions: {},
};

export default function transform(block: Block) {
    // transform data here.
}
```

You can learn more about the package types and modules [in the package
repository](https://github.com/apibara/typescript-sdk/tree/main/packages/indexer).
